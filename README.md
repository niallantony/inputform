# inputform

A project to familiarise myself with form elements and styling. I used flex-box layout to create a relatively responsive layout (with still some hiccups) and a form that follows a certain style (for any Psychedelic rock fans, check out the album of the same name which inspired the styling). Another fun project working with CSS.
